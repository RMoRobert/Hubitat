# Inovelli Drivers

This folder contains custom drivers for Hubitat Elevation for many Inovelli devices. Installation is generally the same as for any custom driver: add the code to **Drivers Code**, then select it as the driver ("Type") for your device if it is not selected on inclusion/pairing or if the device was already added to your hub.

These drivers are created by me and are *not* supported by or related to Inovelli, Hubitat, or drivers either may provide for similar devices.

Driver filenames in this folder generally follow the format of `<model number>-<product description>.groovy`, e.g., `lzw31sn-red-dimmer.groovy` for the Red Series Gen 2 dimmer with model number LZW31-SN.

For assistance with these drivers from the author or other community members, I suggest posting in the Hubitat Community forums, https://community.hubitat.com (in a thread created for many of these drivers or one you might want to create if you can't find one). Please do not open GitHub issues, submit pull requests, etc. here.
