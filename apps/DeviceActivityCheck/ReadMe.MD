# Device Activity Check

This app is primarily designed to periodically check the "Last Acvtivity At" data on selected devices and notify you if
activity has not happened within your specified timeframe. For example, you could select a few motion sensors
and configure Device Activity Check to notify you if they have not generated activity within the last
so many hours as a way to tell if they may have stopped working due to network issues, battery health,
or other problems. This app also supports checking the "deviceHealth" attribute of devices
(a custom attribute used by some devices; ensure the driver supports this, as most do not), the "battery" attribute
(below a certain level), or any combination of these.

For "Last Activity At" monitoring, you will need to have a good feel for how long you are willing to wait before
considering any particular device to be of concern. For example, many door/window and motion sensors also report temperature
data and will often send reports to the hub at least every few hours, if not multiple times per hour, even if there
is no open/close or motion activity. On the other hand, many switches/dimmers and plugs will not send any
reports unless they are phyiscally or digitally used or refreshed. You can configure different intervals for different devices.
In most cases, "activity" will generate an event for the device (check the "Events" tab on the device page in the admin UI),
but what Device Activity Check really looks at is the "Last Activity At" data you can find under "Device Details" on the
device page. Devices must report "Last Activity At" to be usable with "Last Acitivty At" monitoring. (Alternatively,
the attribute-based monitoring types simply the attribute at the time of report.)

For "deviceHealth" devices, the driver should report "online" if the device is online and "offline" if the device
is believed to not be healthy on the network. This is not a standard attribute, but a few community drivers have
used it.

NOTE: Device Activity check does not "monitor" or subscribe to device events per se. It checks device states at the specified
time and/or when the specified switch (likely virtual; this was intended to make the sending of reports be automated
via other means if desired, e.g., Rule Machine) turns on.
This is an intentional design decision to ensure minimal impact on regular hub operation.
